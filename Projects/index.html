            <h4>Search Algorithms</h4>
            <h5>Data Structures and Algorithms</h5>
            Created a program that uses a command line interface to solve a puzzle entered by the user. The puzzle is a
            two dimensional map that the user can move around in and press buttons on the floor that will open specific
            doors, and the goal is to get to the end of the map. The user has multiple options when initiating the
            executable, as they can select a list or map output, and can request that it be solved with a queue or a
            stack

            <h4>Error log manager</h4>
            <h5>Data Structures and Algorithms</h5>
            Created a command line error log manager. The log manager reads in a file of error logs and then allows the
            user to use a command line interface to filter by timestamp, keyword, id, category, and allows the user to
            append a new log entry.

            Implemented simple natural language processing to do post classification. The model is trained on a set of
            posts and then new posts have their vocabulary analyzed and determine the log likelihood of the category for
            the posts.

            Used feature matrices to train a classifier on a set of reviews. The reviews had a positive or negative
            label, and the classifier was trained to have parameters that would divide the positive and negative
            training data points as best as possible. Then it would be used to classify new, unlabeled reviews

            <h4>AdvantageCS Support Website</h4>
            Spent the summer of 2020 recreating the customer support website for AdvantageCS. C# was used with ASP.NET
            core to implement the backend functionality, while CSS, HTML, and Typescript were used for front end
            implementations. The large project took multiple months to get a baseline website, and needed to have
            multiple different functionality. It also used SQL server communication to communicate with backend
            databases
