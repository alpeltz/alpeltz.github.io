            <h4>Priority Queue/Stock Simulator</h4>
            <h5>Data Structures and Algorithms</h5>
            This problem simulated a stock market type environment, using the Star Wars universe as a context. The
            situation of the program was that there were multiple planets, and each planet would have a number of Jedi
            and Sith on it. The Jedi could attack the Sith, while the Sith could also ambush the Jedi, and decisions
            were made based off of high and low power values for each object. This simulates a stock market where
            decisions are made based off of high and low stock prices. Multiple types of queues were implemented.
            <h6><b>Main concepts implemented:</b></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Getopt usage for reading long command line arguments</li>
                <li>Implementation of running medium</li>
                <li>Implementation of priority queues (unordered, unordered fast, sorted, pairing, binary)</li>
                <li>Implementation of pairing heap, which consists of nodes with child and sibling pointers</li>
                <li>Implementation of binary heap that is able to fixUp, and fixDown to ensure the heap is sorted</li>
                <li>Understanding of abstract data types</li>
            </ul>
