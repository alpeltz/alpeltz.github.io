      <p> My name is Amilee Peltz, and I am a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I
        have been programming since high school, and have been extremely passionate about it for years. I am looking
        to find a full-time position after I graduate, which will be May 2021. </p>
      <p>I'm currently living in Ann Arbor, but I'd be very open to relocating; I am especially interested working
        somewhere in the East coast</p>
      <p>My dream job would be creating software that is going to have a positive impact in somebody's life. I feel the
        most proud when I create something that others want that is going to solve a problem that they have.I love
        problem solving, so I get really excited when working on challenging projects.
      </p>
      <p>Over the summer of 2020 I worked as a software development intern at <a
          href="https://www.advantagecs.com/">AdvantageCS</a>, and worked with a small team of people
        to re-design their customer support website. You can read more about that experience
        <a href="/Work-Experience">here</a></p>
      <p>I have extensive experience with Object Oriented Programming from my coursework at school, and have many
        different
        project experiences. You can read more about my <a href="Projects">projects</a> and <a
          href="/Skills">skills</a>.
