      <h3>Technical Experience</h3>
      <h4>AdvantageCS</h4>
      <h5>May 2020-August 2020</h5>
      I Spent the summer of 2020 recreating the customer support website for AdvantageCS. C# was used with ASP.NET
      core to implement the backend functionality, while CSS, HTML, and Typescript were used for front end
      implementations. The large project took multiple months to get a baseline website, and needed to have
      multiple different functionality. It also used SQL server communication to communicate with backend
      databases
      <h6><b>Main concepts implemented:</b></h6>
      <ul>
        <li>SQL server exploration and editing</li>
        <li>Front end/UI experience</li>
        <li>C#/ASP.NET core to create MVC/Razor pages</li>
        <li>Worked with small team as well as communicate with outside team (customer support) in order to design a
          website that would be helpful to both employees and clients.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-Technical Experience</h3>
      <h4>Inn Storage</h4>
      <h5>September-May 2018, 2019, 2020</h5>
      I have worked for the past three school years at Inn Storage, a local storage company. Part of my
      responsibilities include assisting new customers in finding appropriate storage units, providing helpful
      information with a friendly and positive attitude. I also take responsibility of security of small business with
      regards to hundreds of customers belongings. Over the course of this position I have gained responsibility, and
      also improved my social skills with regards to helping customers and making sure that they leave happy and
      satisfied.

      <h4>Qdoba</h4>
      <h5>May-August 2017, 2018, 2019</h5>
      Before my internship in 2020, I spent my summers working as a shift lead at Qdoba in Colorado. This position gave
      me a lot of skills that have even transfered over to my programming skills. I implemented task management skills
      to accomplish all goals by the end of shifts by delegating tasks to various crew members. I used time management
      to organize a fast paced environment during busy hours of the business.
